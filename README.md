## Background
The Scholarship Application Management System addresses the challenges associated with managing scholarship applications efficiently. It ensures secure handling of student data, manages documents like income certificates and mark sheets, and provides a user-friendly interface for both students and administrators. 
This system also enables smooth tracking of application statuses and facilitates role-based interactions to streamline the overall scholarship approval process.
